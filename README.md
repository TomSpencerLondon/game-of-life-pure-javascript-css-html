The Game of Life is just one example of a class of systems called Cellular Automata. We can change the basic algorithm to get other interesting computations. Here's a simple one:

If a cell is live, it stays alive in the next iteration.

If a dead cell has two live cells adjacent to it, the dead cell changes state to live.

The Game of Life is a great metaphor for real Life phenomena such as forest fires or flu transmission or even wealth distribution and land ownership. What is really striking is that the results are affected to a great extent by the start point. For instance:
The glider always progresses in the same way:

This also occurs for other patterns such as 10 line downwards (which makes quite nice images) and also the 3 in a row which always alternates between row and column.

In this game you can pause the game and add a random live cell or dead cell just to see what might happen which is quite interesting as when the system has carefully developed it can lead to complete destruction or atrophy. Perhaps this again is like life!

More information about the Game Of Life is provided on the Cellular Automata Wikipedia page.

Or taking the project in a whole new direction?
Learn about the web sound API and create a generative music app from the Game of Life by assigning samples and sounds to grid locations. You might also check out apps and devices like the Tenori-on for inspiration.

Here are a few of the other possible algorithms:
